Executive Summary 

Teesta-V Power Station is owned and operated by NHPC Limited. The installed 

capacity of Power Station is  510 MW (3x170). The power station is constructed 

on the river scheme with diurnal storage to harness the hydro power potential of 

river  Teesta  for  peaking  during  the  lean  season  and  is  located  in  the  state  of 

Sikkim and 110 KM from Bagdogra Airport by road route. 

The  project  was  commissioned  in  2008  (first  unit  on  28.03.2008,  second  on 

06.02.2008 and third in 20.03.2008). 

The project comprises of a 52 meter high concrete dam with 05 nos. of Spillway 

sluice gates designed for a PMF of 9500 cumec. 

The  powerhouse  has  03-units  of  170  MW  capacity  of  each,  operating  at  a  net 

rated  head  of  197  m.  Annual  Design  Energy  is  1086/1108.17  MU  in  a  90% 

dependable year with 95% machine availability. 

Climate and Rainfall Characteristics  

The  project  catchment  has  its  own  climatic  peculiarities  caused  by  its 

geographical location, relief and altitudinal variation. The maximum and minimum 

temperature  varies  from  37°  C  in  summer  to  8°  C  in  winter  and  the  relative 

humidity varies from 40% to 100%. 

The bulk of the total annual rainfall in the catchment occurs during the months of 

May to October. The average annual rainfall at Damsite (Dikchu) is 2544 mm. 

Water Availability  

The CWC approved water availability series at Teesta-V has been developed on 

the  basis  of  observed  discharges  at  Dikchu.  The  average  annual  runoff  as  per 

the approved water availability series is 7554 MCM. 

Design Flood 

A  Probable  Maximum Flood  of  9500  cumec was  recommended as  design flood 

and later on Revised to 14596 cumec.

Operational History 

The study of plant maintenance was done and following was observed: 

 

There  has  been  no  major  breakdown  of  Plant  &  Machinery  in  the  last  3 

years. 

 

The  power  generation  has  not  been  hampered  (except  for  on  some 

occasions due to very minor issues & that too for short period) due to any 

mechanical problems. 

  As  a  routine  measure,  all  the  03  machines  are  taken-up  for  annual 

maintenance  one-by-one  during  the  lean  Flow  Season  (November  – 

February) each year.   

Construction, build & Civil Infrastructure 

In overall analysis for Civil & Hydro-mechanical works, the following is concluded: 

  The  routine  inspection  system  is  in  place  for  all  the  structures,  in                  

Pre-Monsoon and Post-Monsoon Season. 

  All  Civil  structures 

including  Dam,  Spillways,  embankments,  energy 

dissipation  system  and  working  of  Hydromechanical  components  like 

Gates, stop logs, trunnions etc. is are regularly inspected. 

  The  various  instruments  are  installed  at  all  critical  locations  for  capturing 

Hydrometeorological,  Geo-Technical  &  Geodetic  data  for  observing  any 

movements,  distress  and  also  for  the  routine  data  collection  involving 

measurement of water flow, wind, rainfall data etc. 

  The  study  of  above  does  not  indicate  of  any  movements/  distress  in  the 

structure.    

Breakdown History 

There has been no major damage noted in the plant that could have caused loss 

of  generation  or  major  breakdown.  The  insurers  have  been  notified  of  some 

damages  between  2016-2018  but  all  of  them  have  been  minor  and  well  below 

deductible. The damages due to landslides / flash floods primarily have been to 

road works & have not hampered the generation.

The  generation  data  &  operation  data  of  the  plant  revealed  that  generation  as 

well  as  plant  availability  factor  in  last  5  years  have  always  exceeded  the 

respective annual targets.  

Probable Maximum Loss (PML) 

The generation data & operation data of the machines was studied.

Conclusion 

  Teesta-V has been designed for a probable maximum flood (PMF) of 9,500 

m3/s. In 2011, CWC revised this to 14,596 m3/s.  

  However,  the  maximum  flood  recorded  over  the  past  20  years  was 

3,397m3/s, in 2002. 

  NHPC  is  monitoring  and  is  conducting  safety  inspections  of  the  dam  and 

other  infrastructure  on  a  regular  basis.  Emergency  action  and  disaster 

management  plans  have  been  prepared 

to  enhance  emergency 

preparedness and response capacity. 

  Site  is  well  connected  by  road  in  all  weather  conditions  and  hence  any 

hindrance in project material can be ruled out. 

  The housekeeping in and around the plant is upto mark. 

  Overall, the project is well maintained and running satisfactory.

6.  HYDROLOGY 

Teesta-V is run-of- the river type of project in which waters of Teesta are being 

diverted by dam at Dikchu, 2km downstream of confluence of Dikchu Nala with 

Teesta River. The power house is located at Sirwani with an installed capacity of 

510 MW. 

An  Upstream  operational  Hydropower  Project  named  Teesta-III  (1200  MW)  is  

also built upon Teesta River with its Power House Situated at Mangan, about 50 

km from the Dams Site of Teesta -V. 

The river Teesta is one of the main Himalayan River originating in the glaciers of 

Northern  Sikkim  at  an  elevation  of  8500m.  Flowing  generally  in  the  southern 

direction the river drains the entire state before entering West Bengal at Sevoke 

near  Siliguri.  The  river  in  its  longest  course  on  Lachen  chu  originates  as 

Chemuo chu travelling westward  which turns southward and is joined by  Zemu 

chu on the right bank, Lachen chu further downstream is joined by Lachung chu 

at Chungthang.  

The slope of the Teesta River upto confluence of Lachen chu and Lachung chu 

is  very  steep  gradient,  about  1  in  20.  After  confluence  of  Lachen  chu  and 

Lachung chu the river gradually increases in width and takes a wide loop flowing 

down to Singhik. The total catchment area upto the Teesta-V Dam site is 4307 

sq. Km. 

6.1  Climate and Rainfall Characteristics  

The  project  catchment  has  its  own  climatic  peculiarities  caused  by  its 

geographical  location,  relief  and  altitudinal  variation.  The  maximum  and 

minimum temperature varies from 37° C in summer to 8° C in winter and 

the relative humidity varies from 40% to 100%. 

The  bulk  of  the  total  annual  rainfall  in  the  catchment  occurs  during  the 

months of May to October. The average annual rainfall at Dikchu on basis 

of available data is 2544 mm.

6.2  Water Availability  

The  CWC  approved  water  availability  series  at  Teesta-V  has  been 

developed  on  the  basis  of  observed  discharges  at  Dikchu.  The  average 

annual runoff as per the approved water availability series is 7554 MCM. 

6.3  Design Flood 

A Probable Maximum Flood of 9500 cumec was recommended as design 

flood  and  later  on  Revised  to  14596  Cumec  by  CWC  (central  water 

commission). 

Some  technical  changes  like  raising  a  parapet  wall  on  top  of  dam,  and 

reactivating the diversion tunnels and rechecking the structural safety and 

stability analysis was proposed, however, further details in this regard are 

not available as yet.

Teesta-V Power Station falls in Zone – IV of Earthquake Sensitivity Zone. 

Bureau  of  Indian  Standards  [IS-1893  –  part  –  1:  2002],  based  on  various 

scientific            inputs  from              a  number of agencies  including  earthquake  data 

supplied by IMD, has grouped the country into four seismic zones viz., Zone-II, 

III,  IV  and  V.  Of  these,  zone  V  is  rated  as  the  most  seismically  active  region, 

while zone II is the least

10.  CIVIL  &  HYDROMECHANICAL  RISK  REVIEW  & 

PREVENTIVE MEASURES 

Hazards in power stations can be due to: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Flood /cloud burst 

Fire / explosion 

Earthquake 

Landslides / slide prone area 

Terrorists threats / attacks & Sabotage 

Bomb threat and bomb explosion 

Disruption in power supply, 

10.1.  Hazards 

10.1.1  Flooding at Dam 

Teesta River on which the dam is located is originating from Cho 

Lamo Glacier in the Himalayas. This river is prone to floods in the 

monsoon  season  commencing  from  1st  May  to  31st  October, 

due to  various  reasons  viz.  heavy  rains,  occasional cloud burst, 

landslides, etc. 

10.1.2  Hazards – Landslides/ Snow falls 

The  Teesta-V  Power  Station  lies  in  the  Himalayan  area,  as  the 

area is prone to heavy rain falls/ snow falls, especially during the 

monsoons  and  earthquake,  the  occurrence  of  landslides  at 

different locations is a common phenomenon. 

Damages due to landslides: 

  Landslide in reservoir areas causing flood. 

  Road blockade due to landslides. 

The  various  roads  viz  the  Power  House  to  Dam  site  and  other 

sites are prone to damages often leading to road blockades and 

thereby cutting off essential supplies. 

Ref. No.2021INS100835-Inspection Report (Teesta-V) 

Page: 26 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10.1.3  Hazards – Earthquakes 

It  is  well  known  that  damages  due  to  earthquake  at  a  location 

depend  not  only  on  the  earthquake  size  and  distance  of  the 

earthquake source, but also on the local site conditions. Hazard 

maps  are  essential  for  the  comprehensive  understanding  of 

spatial and temporal occurrences of natural calamities. When an 

area  is  exposed  to  hazards,  a  map  helps  the  planning  team  to 

analyze it for vulnerability/risk and will be useful in the decision-

making process. The hazard maps play a vital role in planning of 

new  development  projects  as  well  as  in  incorporation  of  hazard 

reduction technique into existing developments. 

Teesta-V  Power  Station  lies  in  seismic  zone-IV  and  is  prone  to 

earthquake. 

10.1.4  Hazards  –  Bomb/  Terrorist  Threat,  Terrorist  Attack,  Strike, 

Violent  Agitation,  Sabotage,  Hindrance  in  power  supply, 

Cyber Attack 

Teesta-V  Power  Station  is  situated  in  the  district  East-Sikkim  of 

the State of Sikkim. Looking forward to the security conditions of 

the  National  interest,  there  is  a  constant  threat  to  the  electricity 

producing installations by the anti-national elements, etc. Hence, 

there  is  a  necessity  to  have  a  Crisis  and  Disaster  Management 

Plan. The main aim to have this plan is to prepare the installation 

to  counter the  possible  danger, so that  different  agencies  within 

the power station function in full co-ordination. 

Below  mentioned  emergency  conditions  are  possible  in  the 

installation: 

  Terrorist attack or attack on the security personnel. 

  Bomb attack & bomb threat. 

  Strike by the employees 

  Violent agitation. 

Ref. No.2021INS100835-Inspection Report (Teesta-V) 

Page: 27 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Destruction due to any reason and subsequent hindrance in 

the power supply. 

  Local law and order problem. 

  Cyber attack. 

10.2  Preventive Measures 

10.2.1  Flooding at Dam 

Teesta Dam has been designed for a probable maximum flood 

of 9500 cumecs.  The five nos. of gates at dam are designed 

for passing a continuous flow of 9500 cumec each. 

As  and  when  the  river  discharge  crosses  the  limit  of  500 

cumec  and  sustains  for  a  considerable  period  with  rising 

trends,  the  river  shall  be  considered  under  flood.  It  has  also 

been observed that during the peak summer period i.e. in May 

&  June  due  to  snow  melt  coupled  with  weather disturbances, 

the  river  discharge  increases  suddenly,  often  leading  to  flood 

like situation. 

10.2.2  Prevention  and  Mitigation  of  Hazards  –  Landslides/ 

Snowfalls  

The landslide prone areas are being surveyed before the onset 

of  monsoon  and  necessary  preventive  measures  are 

undertaken. 

Preventing  Measures:  Retaining  &  Breast  Walls,  Cross 

Drainage, Nallah Training Works and Cause Ways have been 

provided to take care. 

Dam (Civil) division shall be responsible for restoration of road 

blockade  due  to  landslides.  Resources  like  Portable  Air 

Compressor, Dumpers, Wheel Dozer, Wheel Loader all should 

be  parked  at  Central  workshop  which  can  be  used  for 

restoration of road communication.

10.2.3  Seismic Design Parameters for Power Station 

The  seismic  design  parameters  for  Teesta-V  power  station 

have  been  adopted  after  detailed  study  of  information  on  the 

tectonic  models  of 

the  Himalayas  and  past  history  of 

earthquakes in the power station area. 

Based  on  the  data  of  earthquake  occurrence  and  geological 

and  tectonic  set  up  of  the  area,  the  seismic  risk  at  power 

station  area  in  terms  of  peak  ground  acceleration  from  has 

been  evaluated  and  the  following  values  have  been  adopted 

for the design of the power station: 

  Horizontal Peak ground acceleration of 0.16 g. 

  Vertical Peak ground acceleration of 0.32 g. 

10.3  Hydro-Mechanical 

  Provision of independent gate with dedicated gantry for each opening 

of penstock (s)/pressure shaft (s) in surge shaft may be considered. 

  Provision  of  independent  gate  with  dedicated  gantry  for  each  Draft 

Tube shall be considered.  

  Outfall structure of TRT shall be planned with suitable gate to prevent 

reverse entry of flood water from the river. 

  Stop logs shall be parked near location of the gates, if possible, so as 

to avoid the time delay in transportation of same during emergency. 

  Provision  of  standby  DG  supply  of  sufficient  capacity  shall  also  be 

made for operation of various gates. 

  Regular preventive checks/maintenance of HRT, surge shaft draft tube.

12.  RISK  REVIEW  -  ELECTROMECHANICAL  RISK  REVIEW  & 

PREVENTIVE MEASURES  

Hazards in power stations may happen due to occurrence of the following events: 

 

 

 

Fire / Explosion 

Flood / Cloud Burst 

Leakage in power house and other underground structures, etc. 

Due to these events, following hazards/ risks may occur: 

12.1  Hazards 

12.1.1   Hazards – Fire/ explosion & Accidents 

The power house is more prone to high hazards due to fire owing 

to storage of large volume of oils, lubricants etc., suffocation and 

limited outlets (for smoke & human being). The cause of fire may 

be  due  to  failure  of  protection  system  of  generator  or  failure  of 

insulation. 

The  transformers are also  prone  to  hazard  like fire &  explosion. 

The  cause  of  fire  may  be  due  to  failure  of  transformer  winding, 

high oil temperature or failure of protection system of transformer. 

Other  likely  prone  areas  are  switchgear  rooms,  cable  galleries, 

GIS, switchyard, etc. 

12.1.2   Hazards – Floods 

  Average  inflow  of  last  24  hrs  is  calculated  based  on  Power 

House Generation and change in reservoir level plus spillage. 

  In  addition, 

information 

regarding  Teesta  Ravi  River 

discharge is also being monitored regularly from G&D site at 

Lachen, Lachung, Chungthang, Sanklang, Dikchu (Dam axis

14.  EQUIPMENT IMPORTANCE 

The importance of the equipment is based on its utility for the running of the unit 
and  the  production  of  power.  The  relative  importance  of  the  equipment  also 

varies with the season in case of a Hydro Power Project. 

The discharge of water in Monsoon Season would be at its Peak; enabling to run 
all  the  units  at  full  load.  Whereas  in  the  winter  season  when  the  discharge  of 

water is low; the running of all 3 units becomes difficult. 

Thus the importance of all the equipment to be operational in the months of high 

discharge is key to the complete power generation. 

The  relative  importance  of  some  of  these  equipment  is  depicted  as  under.  We 
would like to mention that the relative importance; we have considered is for the 

period of high discharge when all units are operational:

15.  PROBABLE MAXIMUM LOSS (PML)  

The PML Assessment is the Probable Maximum Loss that a risk can sustain due 

to fire, explosion or any such incident which is covered under the ambit of policy 

of insurance. 

15.1  PML ASSESSMENT – NATURAL CALAMITY 

We  are  of  the  opinion  that  Maximum  concentration  of  risk  is  at  the 

following areas;

 To arrive at the PML Value, it is pertinent to note the following: 

(a)  These  areas  are  exposed  to  the  catastrophic  risk  of  Earthquake  & 

Flood.  

(b)  The  Generating  Plant  &  Machinery  of  Rs.1,858  Crores 

is 

concentrated  within  the  Power  House,  hence  its  exposure  is  much 

higher.

INR 2,137 Crores 

The PML for Business Interruption shall be in addition to this and can 

go up to complete indemnity period of 12 Months (INR 594.60 Crores) 

15.2  PML ASSESMENT-MACHINERY BREAKDOWN (MLOP) 

15.2.1 Regarding Machinery Breakdown PML 

The  plant  has  No  past  experience  of  any  major  accidents.  From 

detailed discussions with the project authorities and our experience, 

it is found that hydroelectric projects have got low risk of breakdown.  

Insured is maintaining the stock of necessary critical items / spares. 

Some  of  the  critical  spares.  Main  equipment,  Turbine,  Generator 

etc. are of Toshiba make. Lead time for supply of Critical spares will 

take 6 to 12 months’ time. 

The  possibilities  of  damage  to  turbines  include  breakage  of  guide 

blades,  damage  to  rotor or stator of  the  generator. The amount  of 

maximum  damage  to  generator  can  be  to  the  tune  of  INR  145 

Crores.  The  other  damage  under  breakdown  can  occur 

to 

generating transformer, which is about INR 10 Crores each.  Thus, 

maximum loss in an incidence of breakdown can go up to INR 155 

Crores. 

The possibilities of the major breakdown can be in terms of: 

(a)  Damage to turbines 

(b)  Damage to stator / rotor windings  

(c)  Breakage of guide blades 

(d)  Breakdown of transformer 

(e)  Breakdown of control panels (some malfunction of cards). 

(f)  Failure of some pipe joint leading to water inundation. 

Ref. No.2021INS100835-Inspection Report (Teesta-V) 

Page: 51 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Out  of  all  the  above,  the  major  costs  involved  shall  be  damage  to 

stator/ rotor windings of generator or inundation damage. It may be 

noted  that  the  insured  has  sufficient  pump  capacity  to  avoid 

inundation of upper floors.  

We are  of  the  opinion  that  maximum  costs  in  terms  of  Breakdown 

shall not be more than INR 155 Crores in one incident. 

Therefore, 

PML for Breakdown  

= 

INR 155 Crores 

(Material Damage) 

The  damage  on  account  of  breakdown  can  lead  to  stoppage  of 

power  generation.  However  going  by  the  longest  duration  of 

interruption  of  generation  shall  not  be  more  than  1  unit  &  that  too 

not  more  than  12  months.  This  is  possible  only  in  case  where  the 

rotor & stator are severely damaged. 

In  this case the  client shall  be  losing  generation for 1  unit and  the 

loss  on  account  of  business  interruption  shall  not  be  more  than              

INR 200 Crores with 12 months liability period. 

Total PML  

(For Breakdown damage &  

Business Interruption)

15.2.2 PML ASSESMENT- FIRE & ALLIED PERILS 

We  are  not  considering  here  the  damage  on  account  of  natural 

calamities 

for 

the  calculation  of  PML.  However,  as  being 

underground  powerhouse  the  clients  have  taken  adequate  flood 

protection  measures  like  provision  of  floodgates.  Thus  only  the 

damage by fire is possible inside the powerhouse, which has been 

considered by us. 

Ref. No.2021INS100835-Inspection Report (Teesta-V) 

Page: 52 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The risk is well protected by dedicated dewatering pumps and other 

protections as explained earlier. 

The various fire zones can be classified as follows: 

  Single phase transformer. 

  Alternator with associated electrical panels. 

  GIS Gas insulated system equipment. 

  Auxiliaries  belonging  to  one  generating  unit  comprising  of  unit 

auxiliary transformer, lightning arrestor and voltage transformer 

and  grounding  cubicles  and  bus  duct  between  generator  and 

generating transformer. 

  Bus duct 

  Battery room with battery charger & distribution board. 

  Station service transformers with control panels. 

Further,  the  fire  can  damage  some  of  the  surrounding  units.  This 

however  can  be  controlled  with  available  safety  and  firefighting 

measures available.   

15.3  Civil Structure   

The  maximum  cost  incurred  in  the  case  of  civil  structure  is  towards  the 

excavation of the power cavern or the transformer cavern. The other costs 

in terms of civil works would be in terms of following: 

(a)  Excavation 

(b)  Rock Bolting 

(c)  Shotcreting 

(d)  RCC slabs for different floors 

(e)  Flooring 

In event of any major fire in the cavern, the maximum damage are likely to 

occur to the RCC frame works or slabs or flooring. 

However, keeping in view the maximum damage that can occur; we are of 

the opinion that maximum loss under Civil Structure can be to the tune of 

INR 65 Crores only. 

Ref. No.2021INS100835-Inspection Report (Teesta-V) 

Page: 53 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15.4  Plant & Machinery  

  As  per  the  safety  measure  already  discussed  and  the  spread  of  risk, 

following are the areas where Large Fires can take place: 

(a)  A fire in any of the generating unit. 

(b)  A fire in the transformer hall in any of the transformer. 

(c)  A fire in control panel room. 

(d)  A fire in GIS room. 

(e)  A fire in cable gallery. 

  Of  all  the  above  listed  fires,  the  maximum  loss/  spread  shall  be  in  the 

generating unit. 

15.4.1 Generating Unit 

The  cost  of  each  generating  unit  as  installed  at  each  location  of 

Machine hall shall be around INR 280 Crores. This includes the cost 

of  stator,  rotor,  shaft,  runner  and  other  accessories  installed  on  the 

machine. The fire in one unit can spread to other units however the 

damage to other unit can be limited due to effective water fire fighting 

system  and  the  concrete  enclosure  of  the  individual  unit.  The 

maximum, a fire can damage in the individual unit shall not be more 

than 70% of the cost involved at individual unit. Besides it can cause 

damage to the extent of 30% to other 2 units, are on each side. 

Therefore, 

PML of Generating Unit   = 

INR (70% of INR 280 Crores) 

(On account of fire) 

+ 30% of INR 280 x 2 Crores) 

Thus loss due to fire shall be as under:

15.5  Business Interruption 

Any  fire  in  the  unit  shall  lead  to  interruption  of  power  generation  to  not 

more  than  1  unit  for  long  periods  &  other  2  units  for  short  duration.  This 

interruption period can be large if the control cables of each unit which are 

passing  on  the  trays  in  open  area  are  also  affected.    However,  going  by 

Sum  Insured,  the  total  revenue  of  plant  is  around  INR  595  Crores 

depending  upon  the  water  availability  &  plant  running  in  the  Interruption 

period. Thus the damage in the above scenario could be INR 450 Crores. 

Therefore, 

Total PML : 

Fire 

= 

INR (429 + 450) Crores

m3/s. In 2011, CWC revised this to 14,596 m3/s.  

  However,  the  maximum  flood  recorded  over  the  past  20  years  was 

3,397m3/s, in 2002. 

  NHPC  is  monitoring  and  is  conducting  safety  inspections  of  the  dam  and 

other  infrastructure  on  a  regular  basis.  Emergency  action  and  disaster 

management  plans  have  been  prepared 

to  enhance  emergency 

preparedness and response capacity. 

  Site  is  well  connected  by  road  in  all  weather  conditions  and  hence  any 

hindrance in project material can be ruled out. 

  The housekeeping in and around the plant is upto mark. 

  Overall, the project is well maintained and running satisfactory.
