COMMON HAZARDS 

1. Housekeeping: 

Nil 

  a) Indoor: LOW TO MODERATE. The indoor cold storage areas appear generally clean and well-organized, with 
items  stored  on  racking  systems  and  plastic  pallets.  This  suggests  a  professional  approach  to  inventory 
management. However, some appears to be minor clutter or disorganization in non-storage areas, preventing a 
rating of "Low." 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  b)  Outdoor:  MODERATE.  The  exterior  of  the  facility,  particularly  the  yard  and  areas  around  the  refrigeration 
equipment,  shows  significant  signs  of  moderate  housekeeping  which  can  be  manageable.  This  key  area  for 
improvement. 

2. Electrical Installation: MODERATE. The facility has a dedicated transformer and complex electrical systems to power 
its  refrigeration  units.  While  there's  no  direct  evidence  of  poor  installation,  the  sheer  scale  and  importance  of  the 
electrical  infrastructure—as  a  key  ignition  source—warrants  a  "Moderate"  rating.  A  lack  of  visible,  documented 
preventative maintenance (such as thermographic surveys) for this critical system contributes to this rating. 

3.  General  Surroundings:  LOW  TO  MODERATE.  While  the  property's  proximity  to  the  Parañaque  River  is  a  flood 
exposure, the 1.5-meter elevation of the building significantly mitigates this risk. This design choice is a key protective 
feature against minor to moderate flooding events. The adjacent building remains an external exposure. 

4. Smoking: LOW. The company's ISO certifications for quality and food safety suggest a strict, enforced non-smoking 
policy to maintain a safe and clean environment. 

5.  Maintenance  and  Repair:  MODERATE.  The  company's  extensive  experience  and  ISO  certifications  are  strong 
indicators  of  a  professional  maintenance  culture.  However,  the  critical  nature  and  high  value  of the  refrigeration  and 
electrical equipment warrant a vigilant approach that could not be fully confirmed during the survey. 

6. Storage Practice:  LOW  TO  MODERATE.  The use of professional racking systems  and  over 20,000  pallet positions  is 
standard for cold storage. The  availability  of a  sprinkler system  significantly mitigates  the fire  risk associated with  the 
high-piled stock, moving this rating from "Moderate" down to a "Low to Moderate" range.

R e m a r k s 

The presence of a sprinkler system, along with portable extinguishers, a hydrant system, fire alarm system, and lightning 
arresters, significantly mitigates the fire  risk.  The sheer volume  of combustible materials still prevents  a "Low" rating, 
but the comprehensive fire protection infrastructure drastically reduces the exposure from "High." 

Earthquake   

5 

The Philippines' seismic activity poses a significant threat to the large, multi-story structure with its high-density racking 
systems and sensitive refrigeration equipment. This risk remains unchanged. 

Typhoon   

4 

Philippines  is  highly  prone  to  typhoons.  Wind  damage  to  roofing,  external  equipment  (some  corrosion  noted),  and 
potential water ingress pose a risk to the structure and contents. 

Flood 

4 

The explicit location on the Parañaque River makes flooding a primary concern. A major flood event would likely result in 
a total loss of equipment and stored goods. This risk remains unchanged and is a key vulnerability. 

Riot, Strike & Malicious Damage 

3 

The presence of a security team, a controlled business park environment, and perimeter fencing mitigates this risk. 

Falling Aircraft 

1 

The location of risk is far from any commercial or International / domestic flights station area.  

Vehicle Impact 

3 

The  busy  loading  docks  and  congested  yard  increase  the  risk  of  a  vehicle  impacting  the  building  or  key  external 
equipment. 

Explosion  

3 

No materials with a high explosion hazard were identified. The risk of a refrigeration-related explosion is minimal in a 
well-maintained facility.

Sabotage & Terrorism 

1 

The nature of the business does not make it a likely target for these events. 

BOWTAP   

4 

The extensive plumbing for the sprinkler system, hydrant system, and refrigeration systems increases the risk of a burst 
or overflow event. The availability of water tanks and pumps suggests some level of control over the water supply. 

Sprinkler Leakage  

4 

With the confirmation of an available sprinkler system, this exposure is now relevant. A system malfunction could cause 
significant water damage to the stored goods. 

Loss of Rent  

0 

The facility is owner-occupied, mitigating this exposure. 

Loss of Profit/Business Interruption   6 

A  catastrophic  event  from  any  of  the  high-rated  perils  (e.g.,  Earthquake,  Flood)  would  halt  operations,  leading  to  a 
complete cessation of business and significant financial loss. The reliance on continuous operation for the food supply 
chain makes this exposure severe. 

Electrical Fire 

3 

The  presence  of  a  transformer  and  a  stand-by  generator  indicates  a  robust  electrical  setup.  The  risk  is  reduced  from 
"High" to "Moderate" due to the professional nature of the installation and available backup, but it remains a primary 
ignition source. 

Burglary/Robbery  

3 

The  robust  security  system,  including  24/7  guards  and  extensive  CCTV  cameras  with  30-day  recording,  effectively 
mitigates this risk. 

LOSS ESTIMATES 

Possible Maximum Loss (PML) 

Possible Maximum Loss is a  loss that may occur when the most unfavorable circumstances are more or less 
exceptionally  combined,  and  when,  as  a  consequence,  fire  is  not  or  unsatisfactorily  fought  against  and  is 
therefore only stopped by impassable obstacle or by lack of combustible materials. 

The risk can be divided into several fire-areas numbered in the following; 

1. No. of Fire Areas  
2. Buildings involved  
3. Percentage of Loss 

1 Fire Area 
3 Buildings 
100% of MAS 

 Maximum Probable Loss (MPL) 

Maximum  Probable  Loss  is  a  loss  that  may  occur  under  circumstances  assuming  all  existing  fire  protection 
functioning as intended and competent private or public fire brigade assistance is available. 

Considering the construction / isolation of the buildings, combustible loading and the available fire protection, 
MPL is estimated at around 30% of the entire risk.

Opinion of the Risk 

The Glacier Megafridge facility presents a solid, professionally managed risk. The company's significant investment in its 
infrastructure and operations, including a sprinkler system and robust security. The ongoing merger with Ayala Company 
is a strong vote of confidence in the business and likely provides additional financial stability. 

However, the facility remains highly exposed to Earthquake and Flood, which are inherent to its location. The Business 
Interruption exposure is also severe due to the sheer volume and value of the products handled. 

The risk is ACCEPTABLE for All-Risk insurance purposes. The premiums should reflect the remaining high exposures to 
flood, earthquake, and business interruption. The client should be strongly encouraged to act on the recommendations 
to further reduce their overall risk profile and secure their long-term operations.
