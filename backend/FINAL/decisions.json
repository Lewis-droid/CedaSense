Such a mistake or omission shall be corrected after its discovery by signing the Addendum.\nApplicable Taxes\nApplicable tax \u2013 non-resident revenue tax 5% shall be withdrawn by the Reinsured upon transfer of the reinsurance premium due unless having the actual and applicable reinsurer\u2019s and reinsurance broker\u2019s residency certificate if applicable\nPremium Payment Conditions\nPayment of premium shall be made in USD by the Reinsurance Broker. All charges and commission related to transfer of premiums shall be borne by the payer\nThe insurance shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the legislation of Egypt.\nThe reinsurance slip is subject to the application of Arbitration Clause.\n(Re)Insurers Liability Clause: LMA3333\n(Re)Insurer\u2019s liability several not joint: The liability of a (Re)Insurer under this contract is several and not joint with other (Re)Insurers party to this contract. A (Re)Insurer is liable only for the proportion of liability it has underwritten. A (Re)Insurer is not jointly liable for the proportion of liability underwritten by any other (Re)Insurer. Nor is a (Re)Insurer otherwise responsible for any liability of any other (Re)Insurer that may underwrite this contract. The proportion of liability under this contract underwritten by a (Re)Insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd\u2019s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together) is shown next to its stamp. This is subject always to the provision concerning \u201csigning\u201d below. In the case of a Lloyd\u2019s syndicate, each member of the syndicate (rather than the syndicate itself) is a (Re)Insurer. Each member has underwritten a proportion of the total shown for the syndicate (that total itself being the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together). The liability of each member of the syndicate is several and not joint with other members. A member is liable only for that member\u2019s proportion. A member is not jointly liable for any other member\u2019s proportion. Nor is any member otherwise responsible for any liability of any other (Re)Insurer that may underwrite this contract. The business address of each member is Lloyd\u2019s, One Lime Street, London EC3M 7HA. The identity of each member of a Lloyd\u2019s syndicate and their respective proportion may be obtained by writing to Market Services, Lloyd\u2019s, at the above address.\nProportion of liability: Unless there is \u201csigning\u201d (see below), the proportion of liability under this contract underwritten by each (Re)Insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd\u2019s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together) is shown next to its stamp and is referred to as its \u201cwritten line\u201d. Where this contract permits, written lines, or certain written lines, may be adjusted (\u201csigned\u201d). In that case a schedule is to be appended to this contract to show the definitive proportion of liability under this contract underwritten by each (Re)Insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd\u2019s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of a Lloyd\u2019s syndicate taken together). A definitive proportion (or, in the case of a Lloyd\u2019s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of a Lloyd\u2019s syndicate taken together) is referred to as a \u201csigned line\u201d. The signed lines shown in the schedule will prevail over the written lines unless a proven error in calculation has occurred. Although reference is made at various points in this clause to \u201cthis contract\u201d in the singular, where the circumstances so require this should be read as a reference to contracts in the plural.\nOrder hereon: 95.00% of whole\nBasis of written lines: Percentages of Whole.\nSigning provisions: In the event that the written lines hereon exceed 100% of the order, any lines written \u201cTo Stand\u201d will be allocated in full and all other lines will be signed down in equal proportions so that the aggregate signed lines are equal to 100% of the order without further agreement to any of the (Re)Insurers. However: in the event that the placement of the order is not completed by the commencement date of the period of insurance, then all lines written by that date will be signed in full; the reinsured may elect for the disproportionate signing of the (Re)Insurers\u2019 lines, without further specific agreement of the (Re)Insurers, providing that any such variation is made prior to the commencement date of the period of insurance, and that lines written \u201cTo Stand\u201d can not be varied without the agreement of those (Re)Insurers; the signed lines resulting from the application of the above provisions can be varied, before or after the commencement date of the period of insurance, by the agreement of the reinsured and all (Re)Insurers whose lines are to be varied. The variation to the contracts will take effect only when all such (Re)Insurers have agreed, with the resulting variation in signed lines commencing from the date set out in that agreement.\nB.I.P.A.R.
